Worked on:
	- Just finished the New Game page
		* Added data validation for the Minutes, and min and max num of players to make sure the user enters a number in
		* Made some changes to the way the datastore was working in the base view model. It is now saving Games as it should to the database
To do:
	> Add color to the Game items on the main page so it is easier to see the different games
	/> Add a Game List Detail page and view model so the user can see / update info for each games
	/> Add a delete button to the Game Detail page
	> Add a tab at the bottom that will allow users to enter in details to generate a random game to play
	> Add a magnifying glass at the top right of the main page to allow users to search for a specific game
Worked on:
	- Added a Game List Detail page and eview model
	- Added a delete button to the game detail page
	- Added colors to support Dark Theme
	- Created a new RandomGameGeneratorPage and view model
	- Added that new page to the shell tab bar
To do:
	> Add color to the Game Items on the main page so it is easier to see the different games
	> Finish creating the RandomGameGeneratorPage so the user can enter in the amount of time they have and the number of players and the app will produce a game
		* Maybe this should generate a random game and display all of the games that match the entered criteria?
	> Add a magnifying glass at the top right of the main page to allow users to search for a specific game on the main page
	> Maybe add functionality to allow users to upload multiple games into the data base using a csv batch upload process?
